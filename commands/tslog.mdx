title: ':TSLog'
description: View log messages from parser installation, update, and uninstall operations
---

## Overview

The `:TSLog` command displays all messages and output from previous parser operations, including installations, updates, and uninstalls. This is useful for debugging installation issues or reviewing operation history.

## Syntax

```vim
:TSLog
```

The command takes no arguments.

## Behavior

- Opens a buffer displaying log messages from parser operations
- Shows output from install, update, and uninstall commands
- Includes compilation output, errors, and success messages
- Logs persist across Neovim sessions

<Note>
  The log view is particularly helpful for diagnosing why a parser installation failed, as it includes full compiler output and error messages.
</Note>

## Use Cases

### Debugging installation failures

If `:TSInstall` fails silently or with minimal information:

```vim
:TSInstall rust
" ... installation fails or completes with errors ...
:TSLog
```

The log will show:
- Compiler errors and warnings
- Missing dependencies
- Network issues during download
- File system permission problems

### Reviewing operation history

Check what operations were performed:

```vim
:TSLog
```

View a history of:
- Which parsers were installed and when
- Update results for each parser
- Uninstall confirmations

### Verifying successful operations

Confirm that batch operations completed successfully:

```vim
:TSInstall stable
:TSLog  " Review results for all stable parsers
```

## Log Contents

The log typically includes:

- **Operation type**: Install, update, or uninstall
- **Language names**: Which parsers were affected
- **Timestamps**: When operations occurred
- **Compilation output**: Compiler warnings and errors
- **Network activity**: Download progress and failures
- **Success/failure status**: Summary of results

## Example Log Output

```text
[INFO] Installing parser for rust
[INFO] Downloading from https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter-rust
[INFO] Compiling parser.c...
[INFO] Successfully installed rust parser

[ERROR] Installing parser for python
[ERROR] Compilation failed: missing gcc
[ERROR] Failed to install python parser

[INFO] Updating javascript parser
[INFO] Already up to date
```

## Troubleshooting with TSLog

### Check for missing build tools

Look for errors mentioning:
- `gcc`, `clang`, or `cc` not found
- Missing C compiler
- Build tool configuration issues

### Identify network issues

Look for:
- Connection timeout messages
- Git clone failures
- Download interruptions

### Verify parser compatibility

Check for:
- ABI version mismatches
- Neovim version requirements
- Treesitter library compatibility

## Related Commands

- `:TSInstall` - Install parsers (generates logs)
- `:TSUpdate` - Update parsers (generates logs)
- `:TSUninstall` - Remove parsers (generates logs)
- `:checkhealth nvim-treesitter` - Check parser status and configuration

## Source Implementation

Implemented in `plugin/nvim-treesitter.lua:71-75`:

```lua
api.nvim_create_user_command('TSLog', function()
  require('nvim-treesitter.log').show()
end, {
  desc = 'View log messages',
})
```
