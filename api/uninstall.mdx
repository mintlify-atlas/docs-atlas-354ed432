## uninstall(languages, opts)

Remove the parser and queries for the specified language(s). This deletes both the compiled parser library and the associated query files from the installation directory.

<Warning>
This operation is destructive and cannot be undone. The parser and queries will need to be reinstalled if needed again.
</Warning>

### Parameters

<ParamField path="languages" type="string|string[]" required>
  Language(s) to uninstall. Can be:
  - A single language name (e.g., `"rust"`)
  - An array of language names (e.g., `{ "rust", "javascript" }`)
  - A tier name: `"stable"`, `"unstable"`, or `"all"` to uninstall all parsers
  
  Only parsers installed via nvim-treesitter will be uninstalled.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="opts" type="table" optional>
  Uninstall options
  
  <Expandable title="properties">
    <ParamField path="summary" type="boolean" default="false">
      Print a summary of successful and total operations when uninstalling multiple languages.
    </ParamField>
  </Expandable>
</ParamField>

### Returns

This function does not return a value (returns `nil`).

<Note>
This function is asynchronous but does not return an awaitable object like `install()` and `update()`.
</Note>

### Usage

#### Uninstall a Single Parser

```lua
require('nvim-treesitter').uninstall('rust')
```

#### Uninstall Multiple Parsers

```lua
require('nvim-treesitter').uninstall({ 'rust', 'javascript', 'python' })
```

#### Uninstall All Parsers

```lua
require('nvim-treesitter').uninstall('all')
```

#### Uninstall with Summary

```lua
require('nvim-treesitter').uninstall(
  { 'lua', 'vim', 'python' },
  { summary = true }
)
```

### Uninstall Process

For each language, the function:

1. **Verify**: Checks if the parser is managed by nvim-treesitter
2. **Remove Parser**: Deletes the compiled parser library (`.so` file) from the `parser/` directory
3. **Remove Queries**: Deletes query files from the `queries/` directory (handles both symlinks and regular directories)
4. **Cleanup**: Removes parser metadata from `parser-info/`

### Behavior Details

- Parser dependencies are **not** automatically uninstalled (to prevent breaking other parsers that might depend on them)
- If a parser is not found or not managed by nvim-treesitter, a warning is logged
- Query directories are handled differently based on their type:
  - **Symlinks**: Simply unlinked
  - **Directories**: Recursively removed with all contents

<Info>
Only parsers installed in nvim-treesitter's configured installation directory are affected. Parsers installed system-wide or via other methods are ignored.
</Info>

### Verification

To check which parsers are managed by nvim-treesitter and can be uninstalled:

```lua
local installed = require('nvim-treesitter').get_installed()
print(vim.inspect(installed))
```

<Note>
Parsers installed from other sources or placed anywhere else on `runtimepath` will not be listed by `get_installed()` and cannot be uninstalled via this function.
</Note>

### Warnings

You'll see a warning if you try to uninstall a parser that is:
- Not installed
- Not managed by nvim-treesitter
- Installed from a different source

Example warning message:
```
Parser for <language> is not managed by nvim-treesitter
```
