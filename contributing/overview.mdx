# Contributing to nvim-treesitter

The main parts of `nvim-treesitter` are:
- A curated list of **parsers** for various programming languages
- A collection of **queries** that enable tree-sitter features in Neovim

## Prerequisites

Before contributing, we recommend familiarizing yourself with:

- [Tree-sitter documentation](https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/) - Understanding how tree-sitter works
- [Neovim's tree-sitter documentation](https://neovim.io/doc/user/treesitter.html#treesitter) - Neovim-specific implementation details

## Getting Help

There are dedicated Matrix channels for questions and general help:

- [#nvim-treesitter](https://matrix.to/#/#nvim-treesitter:matrix.org) - Questions specific to Neovim's implementation and the queries
- [#tree-sitter](https://matrix.to/#/#tree-sitter-chat:matrix.org) - General tree-sitter questions and CLI usage

## What Can You Contribute?

### Parsers

Add support for new languages by registering parsers that meet the inclusion criteria. See [Adding Parsers](/contributing/adding-parsers) for detailed instructions.

### Queries

Improve or create queries for:

- **highlights.scm** - Syntax highlighting
- **injections.scm** - Multi-language support
- **folds.scm** - Code folding
- **indents.scm** - Automatic indentation (experimental)
- **locals.scm** - Scope tracking (limited support)

See [Writing Queries](/contributing/writing-queries) for guidelines.

## Development Workflow

<Steps>
  <Step title="Fork and Clone">
    Fork the repository and clone it locally:
    
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/nvim-treesitter.git
    cd nvim-treesitter
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Make Changes">
    Make your changes to parsers or queries following the guidelines in the respective sections.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Test Locally">
    Use the testing tools to verify your changes work correctly. See [Testing](/contributing/testing) for details.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Submit Pull Request">
    Open a pull request with a clear description of your changes.
  </Step>

## Quality Standards

### For Parsers

<Warning>
  All parsers must:
  - Correspond to a filetype detected by Neovim (nightly)
  - Be feature complete, tested, and actively maintained
  - Be hosted or mirrored on GitHub
  - Be covered by CI using [upstream workflows](https://github.com/tree-sitter/workflows)
  - Provide reference queries covered by a `ts_query_ls` workflow
  - Support the latest ABI (if `src/parser.c` exists)
  - Contain an up-to-date `src/grammar.json` (if no `src/parser.c`)
  - Use C99 for external scanners
</Warning>

### For Queries

- Follow standard formatting (2 spaces per nesting level, one node per line)
- Use only valid captures for Neovim (different from Helix or other editors)
- Ensure patterns are valid for the parser version in nvim-treesitter
- Run `make query` before submitting (formats, lints, and checks)

## Tools and Commands

The following commands are available for development:

```bash
# Lua code quality
make formatlua    # Format Lua code with StyLua
make checklua     # Check Lua code with lua-language-server

# Query management
make formatquery  # Format all queries
make lintquery    # Lint queries for valid captures
make checkquery   # Check queries against installed parsers
make query        # Run all query checks (format + lint + check)

# Documentation
make docs         # Update SUPPORTED_LANGUAGES.md

# Testing
make tests        # Run all tests
```

## Parser Tiers

nvim-treesitter uses a two-tier system:

### Tier 1 (Preferred)

Tier 1 parsers provide the best stability and are **strongly recommended** for new additions:

- Make regular releases following semantic versioning:
  - **Patch** - Fixes not affecting queries
  - **Minor** - New nodes or patterns
  - **Major** - Removed nodes or breaking changes
- Provide WASM release artifacts
- Meet all general parser requirements

### Tier 2

Tier 2 parsers track the latest commit instead of versioned releases. While acceptable, they may cause breaking changes without notice.

## Code of Conduct

Be respectful and constructive in all interactions. We're building tools to help developers, and positive collaboration makes better software.

## Next Steps

- [Add a new parser](/contributing/adding-parsers)
- [Write or improve queries](/contributing/writing-queries)
- [Learn about testing](/contributing/testing)
