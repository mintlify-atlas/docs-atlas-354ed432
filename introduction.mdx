## What is nvim-treesitter?

The `nvim-treesitter` plugin provides three core capabilities for Neovim:

1. **Parser management**: Functions for installing, updating, and removing [Tree-sitter parsers](https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/) for over 300 programming languages
2. **Query collections**: Curated sets of queries that enable Tree-sitter features built into Neovim (highlighting, folding, indentation, injections)
3. **Experimental features**: A staging ground for Tree-sitter-based functionality considered for upstreaming to Neovim core

<Note>
  This plugin focuses on parser and query management. The actual Tree-sitter features (like syntax highlighting) are built into Neovim itself.
</Note>

## Why use nvim-treesitter?

Tree-sitter provides several advantages over traditional regex-based syntax:

- **Accurate parsing**: Tree-sitter builds a complete syntax tree, understanding your code's structure
- **Performance**: Incremental parsing means only changed portions are re-parsed
- **Consistency**: The same parser powers highlighting, navigation, text objects, and more
- **Language support**: Over 300 languages with actively maintained parsers

## Quick example

Here's how to install parsers and enable highlighting:

```lua
-- Install parsers for your languages
require('nvim-treesitter').install({ 'rust', 'javascript', 'python' })

-- Enable highlighting for specific filetypes
vim.api.nvim_create_autocmd('FileType', {
  pattern = { 'rust', 'javascript', 'python' },
  callback = function()
    vim.treesitter.start()
  end,
})
```

## Requirements

Before installing nvim-treesitter, ensure you have:

- **Neovim 0.11.0 or later** (nightly builds are supported)
- **`tar` and `curl`** in your PATH for downloading parsers
- **`tree-sitter-cli`** version 0.26.1 or later
- **A C compiler** for building parsers from source

<Warning>
  The support policy covers only the latest stable and nightly releases of Neovim. Compatibility with older versions is not guaranteed.
</Warning>

## Supported languages

The plugin supports parsers for over 300 languages, organized into tiers:

- **Stable**: Follow semantic versioning for updates
- **Unstable**: Track the HEAD of the parser repository
- **Unmaintained**: No automatic updates available
- **Unsupported**: Known to be broken

For each language, nvim-treesitter may provide queries for:

- **H**ighlights
- **F**olds
- **I**ndents
- In**j**ections (language injections)
- **L**ocals (definitions and references)

<Tip>
  Check the [supported languages list](https://github.com/nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter/blob/main/SUPPORTED_LANGUAGES.md) to see which features are available for your language.
